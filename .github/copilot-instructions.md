## Update Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when updating or adding new code:

1. The code should be written 
  * in a professional manner
  * preferring clarity and maintainability
  * if some approach seems to be not the best, please clearly state it and wait for confirmation

2. New files should be added to aiteacher/generated/ directory

3. Use type hints for all functions and methods

4. Include docstrings for all classes and functions using the Google style.

5. Make tests in tests directory for any new functionality added. Use pytest framework, avoid unittest unless absolutely necessary. Avoid line-by-line mocking; prefer really testing the logic.
